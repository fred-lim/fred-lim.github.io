### Exercise 1

<div class="solution">
    <div class="solution-header">Solution:</div>
    We shall prove this by contradction. <br>
    Assume that \(r+x\) is rational. <br>
    Since \(r+x\) is rational and \(-r\) is rational, <br>
    we have \(x\) is rational. <br>
    Thus there is a contradiction. <br>
    Assume that \(rx\) is rational. <br>
    Since \(rx\) is rational and \(\frac{1}{r}\) is rational, <br>
    we have \(x\) is rational. <br>
    Thus there is a contradiction.
</div>

### Exercise 1b

<div class="solution">
    <div class="solution-header">Solution:</div>
    The binary operation is associative. <br>
    Let \(a,b,c\in\mathbb{R}\) 
    \begin{align*}
    (a\star b)\star c =& (a+b+ab)\star c \\
    =& a+b+ab+c+(a+b+ab)c \\
    =& a+b+ab+c+ac+bc+abc \\
    =& a+b+c+bc+ab+ac+abc \\
    =& a\star(b+c+bc)
    \end{align*}
</div>
